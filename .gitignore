# Ignore the build directory contents, but not the directory itself initially
build/*

# Don't ignore the 'output' subdirectory within build/
!build/output/

# Now, ignore everything inside 'output'
build/output/*

# But re-include the specific file
!build/output/final.json

# Ignore all files with .tmp extension
*.tmp

# And ignore the entire 'logs' directory
logs/

# If you specifically want to include a file inside a generally ignored directory
# You would first need to ensure the parent directories are not fully ignored.
# If 'logs/' is ignored, you cannot re-include 'logs/errors.txt' directly.
# The previous multi-line approach is necessary.

# However, if you have a pattern like `bin/*` (ignoring contents, not the dir itself)
# you can re-include a file from there.
# Example: Ignore everything in `bin/` but keep `bin/executable.exe`
bin/*
!bin/executable.exe

# Ignore Microsoft Word documents
*.docx

# Ignore Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
*.xlsx

# You can also add other common document types if needed:
# Ignore Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
# *.pptx

# Ignore PDF documents
# *.pdf

# Ignore temporary files created by office applications
# ~$*.docx
# ~$*.xlsx
# ~$*.pptx
